### Database ###
# A database is an organized collection of information.
# A Relational Data Base Management System / RDBMS provides tools to manage the database. It parses requests from the user and takes the appropriate action. The user doesn't have direct access to the stored data.
# Table - the main building block of any database;
- Each row is called a record or entity
- Columns (fields) define the type of data they contain. Table columns have fixed types.
- Table relations reduce repetition and complexity.
# Structured Query Language /SQL/ - Declarative language
- To communicate with the Engine we use SQL.
- Logically divided in four sections:
	- Data Definition – describe the structure of our data
	- Data Manipulation – store and retrieve data
	- Data Control – define who can access the data
	- Transaction Control – bundle operations and allow rollback 
- SQL provides greater control over actions.
# Data Types in SQL Server:
- Numeric:
	BIT (1-bit), TINYINT (8-bit), SMALLINT (16-bit)
	INT (32-bit), BIGINT (64-bit)
	FLOAT, REAL, DECIMAL(precision, scale)
- Textual:
	CHAR(size) – fixed size string
	VARCHAR(size) – variable size string
	NCHAR(size) – Unicode fixed size string
	NVARCHAR(size) – Unicode variable size string
- Binary data
	BINARY(size) – fixed length sequence of bits
	VARBINARY(size) – a sequence of bits, 1-8000 bytes or MAX (2GB)
- Date and time
	DATE – date in range 0001-01-01 through 9999-12-31
	DATETIME – date and time with precision of 1/300 sec
	DATETIME2 –  type that has a larger date range
	SMALLDATETIME – date and time (1 minute precision)
	TIME – defines a time of a day (no time zone)
	DATETIMEOFFSET – date and time that has time zone
